## Architecture

**Single control plane**: `EmergeDaemon` (`scripts/emerge_daemon.py`) is the only MCP server. It handles all five tools (`icc_exec`, `icc_read`, `icc_write`, `icc_crystallize`, `icc_reconcile`) and all four resources (`policy://`, `runner://`, `state://`, `pipeline://`). There is no second server.

**Two execution paths for pipelines**: `icc_read`/`icc_write` run locally by default (daemon calls `PipelineEngine` in-process). When `RunnerRouter` resolves a client for the request, the daemon loads pipeline `.py`+`.yaml` locally, builds a self-contained inline `exec()` payload, and POSTs it as `icc_exec` to the remote runner. The runner never receives pipeline files — switching machines is a URL change only.

**Policy never leaves the daemon**: all lifecycle state (`candidates.json`, `pipelines-registry.json`), WAL, and metrics are written locally regardless of whether execution is local or remote.

**Flywheel bridge**: inside `icc_exec`, when a candidate matching `intent_signature`+`script_ref` is `stable`, execution short-circuits to the pipeline result without LLM inference. Bridge key: `flywheel::<pipeline_id>::<intent_signature>::<script_ref>`.

**`from __future__` stripping**: pipeline `.py` files may contain `from __future__ import annotations`. This line is stripped before injection into `exec()` payloads (it raises `SyntaxError` when not first in a string).

**Human-fix targeting**: `icc_reconcile` with `outcome=correct` increments `human_fix_rate` only on the candidate with the highest `last_ts_ms` matching the `intent_signature` — the most-recently-used one. Never all matching candidates.

## Test Infrastructure

`conftest.py` sets two `autouse` fixtures:
- `_mock_connector_root`: sets `EMERGE_CONNECTOR_ROOT` to `tests/connectors/` so `PipelineEngine` finds the mock connector
- `isolate_runner_config`: clears runner env vars so tests never hit a real remote runner

Tests that need a real runner (`test_remote_runner.py`) start their own in-process server via `_RunnerServer`.

Integration tests go in `test_mcp_tools_integration.py` and call `EmergeDaemon.call_tool(...)` directly — not through JSON-RPC. This is the primary integration surface.

## Key Invariants

- `icc_exec` **requires** `intent_signature` — enforced by `PreToolUse` hook which blocks the call with convention guidance if missing.
- Connector pipelines live in `~/.emerge/connectors/<connector>/pipelines/{read,write}/` (user-space). `tests/connectors/` is test fixture only, not shipped.
- Policy state files use atomic writes (temp file + rename). Never write directly.
- WAL entries with `no_replay=True` are excluded from both replay and crystallization. State setup entries must not use `no_replay`.
- `EMERGE_OPERATOR_MONITOR=1` enables `OperatorMonitor` thread in the daemon. Off by default. Polls remote runners via `GET /operator-events`, runs `PatternDetector`, pushes to CC via MCP channel notification (explore) or `ElicitRequest` (canary/stable).
- `ObserverPlugin` (`scripts/observer_plugin.py`) is the ABC for all operator observation. `AdapterRegistry` loads built-in observers (`scripts/observers/`) and crystallized vertical adapters from `~/.emerge/adapters/<vertical>/adapter.py`. Vertical adapters are built via `icc_crystallize mode=adapter` (not shipped, crystallized per-user).
- `EventBus`: `~/.emerge/operator-events/<machine_id>/events.jsonl` — append-only. Written via `POST /operator-event` on the remote runner. `session_role=monitor_sub` events are filtered by `PatternDetector` to prevent AI self-monitoring.
